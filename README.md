# How to Change Accent Color?
To change from the **original** blueviolet theme you have to open the main```bl.css``` file and you can change the following:
```css
:root{
  --_: rgb(/* Your accent's RGB here */);
  --_4: rgba(/* Your RGB */, 0.4);
  --_6: rgba(/* Your RGB */, 0.6);
}
```
# Repo
The bl-css repo is on [GitHub](https://github.com/fg-xd/bl-CSS)

You can also make an issue on GitHub to request features

# How to use?
## Plug 'n' Play (not recommended for big sites)
Add this to your HTML for the latest&greatest version:
```html
<link rel='stylesheet' href='https://esm.sh/bl-css' />
```
Its a very short URL too! (credit to [esm.sh](https://esm.sh))

## Download
### 1. NPM
This is the most recommended method

Run this in your terminal(for latest version):
```bash
npm install bl-css
```
If you'd want, you can target a specific version:
```bash
npm install bl-css@version
# note: version to be replaced with actual version or the alien will eat bl-css
```
### 2. GitHub
This is not recommended as I most of the time forget to make a release on github T-T

Go to the official [GitHub repo releases](https://github.com/fg-xd/bl-CSS/releases) and download a certain version you want.

Have a Nice day Using it **:D**

Forever Free **:D**
