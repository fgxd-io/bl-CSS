# How to Change Accent Color?
To change from the **original** blueviolet theme you have to open the main```bl.css``` file and you can change the following:
```css
:root{
	--_: rgb(/* Your accent's RGB here */)
	--_4: rgba(/* Your RGB */, 0.4)
	--_6: rgba(/* Your RGB */, 0.6)
}
```

Have a Nice day Using it **:D**
