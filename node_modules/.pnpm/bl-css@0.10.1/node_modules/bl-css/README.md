# bl CSS
A *lightweight*, **blueviolet**, ***small*** CSS framework!

# 0.10.1 - Release notes(by Dev)
License Update! I don't have much to include here, you can read the license on [github](https://github.com/fg-xd/bl-CSS/blob/main/LICENSE). It is a GNU LGPLv2.1 license, which basically means if you build a website, you can optionally credit me, but if you are editing the main bl-css file you must credit me and keep it open source.
# How to Change Accent Color?
To change from the **original** blueviolet theme you have to open the main```bl.css``` file and you can change the following:
```css
:root{
	--_: rgb(/* Your accent's RGB here */)
	--_4: rgba(/* Your RGB */, 0.4)
	--_6: rgba(/* Your RGB */, 0.6)
}
```
# Repo
The bl-css repo is on [GitHub](https://github.com/fg-xd/bl-CSS)

You can also make an issue on GitHub to request features

Have a Nice day Using it **:D**

Forever Free **:D**
